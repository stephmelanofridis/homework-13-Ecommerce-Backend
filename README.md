For this weeks homework we were supplied with starter code and were asked to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MYSQL database. The requirements were to set up the database models, define relationships between the models and fill out the unfinished routes. We were also required to use dotenv to protect our sensitive information from being visible.

    mysql -u root -p
Enter your password, then  
    SOURCE db/schema.sql;
